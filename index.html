        <p class="text">Hello! I'm Carmen and I come from Tongeren. Ever since I got my first computer, I've been really interested in IT. When I was a kid, I used to make simple websites using Notepad just for fun. Later, I started creating websites for family businesses.</p>
        <p class="text">My hobbies, programming and gaming, merged when I decided to make a game in RPGMaker. But I wanted to do more than what the basic tools could do. This made me want to learn more about programming. I took some online courses and then decided to learn even more by joining the bachelor flextraject of KdG.</p>
        <p class="text">That's where I discovered that I really love programming and I want to do it as a job. So, you can imagine how excited I was when I found out about the Switchfully program and got selected for it!</p>
